# Titanic Survived Passengers

A machine learning classification project using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and multiple classification models to analyze and predict outcomes.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Model training using multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/M07amedrabea/Titanic-Survived-Passengers.git
   cd yourrepository
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook Code.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn

## Dataset

This project uses the Titanic dataset (or a similar dataset) for classification. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file named `train.csv`.
